# CNO Astro Camp Rover Game
A game built in stages to help teach coding and game design during the CNO Astro Camp partnership with NASA 2024.

## Resources
- The initial idea and some initial code came from JPL and their activity [Code a Mars Rover Driving Game](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/edu/resources/project/code-a-mars-rover-driving-game/).
- Assets also came from the JPL activity at these links.

## Getting started
- First make sure you have Python installed ([instrustions here](https://github.com/cno-enterprise-services/astro_camp_rover_game/blob/main/lesson_0.md#install-python)).
- Next ensure you have the Python library pygame installed ([instructions here](https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted)).
  ```bash
  python3 -m pip install -U pygame --user
  ```
